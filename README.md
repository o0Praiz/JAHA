### Advanced Configuration

For production deployment, see the [Operational Deployment Guide](docs/operational_deployment_framework.md) for comprehensive setup instructions, security configuration, and performance optimization.

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Operations

```python
from jah_agency import JAHAgency

# Initialize the agency
agency = JAHAgency(config_file='config/config.yaml')

# Start autonomous operations
agency.start_autonomous_mode()

# Monitor system status
status = agency.get_system_status()
print(f"Active Agents: {status.active_agents}")
print(f"Revenue Today: ${status.daily_revenue}")
print(f"Tasks Completed: {status.completed_tasks}")
```

### Financial Reporting

```python
# Generate financial report
report = agency.financial_system.generate_weekly_report()

# Access key metrics
print(f"Total Revenue: ${report.total_revenue}")
print(f"Operating Expenses: ${report.operating_expenses}")
print(f"Net Profit: ${report.net_profit}")
```

### Agent Management

```python
# Create specialized agent
marketing_agent = agency.create_agent(
    agent_type='marketing',
    specialization='content_creation',
    resource_allocation=0.5
)

# Assign task
task_result = marketing_agent.execute_task({
    'type': 'create_campaign',
    'target_audience': 'small_businesses',
    'budget': 5000
})
```
